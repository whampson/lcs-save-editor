    liveries, vehicle orientation, and special properties like BP/CP/FP/EP and

    available.

## System Requirements
  - Windows PC
  - [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)

You may also choose to run the standalone version of this tool, which includes
the .NET runtime bundled inside the executable, but at the cost of a much larger
file size.

## Extracting Save Files
In order to edit save files, you'll need to extract them from your console or
mobile device.

### Android
Save files are located at `/data/data/com.rockstargames.gtalcs/files/`. You'll
need a rooted device to access save files.

### iOS
Save files are located in the Documents folder. You'll need a jailbroken device
to access save files if you're using iOS 8.3 or newer.

### PS2
You'll need a cheat device, memory card reader, or a softmodded console to
extract save files from the memory card. If you're using PCSX2, use
[mymc](http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca:11068/mymc/) to access the files on the
virtual memory card. Use PS2 Save Builder [PS2 Save Builder](https://www.ps2savetools.com/download/ps2-save-builder/)
to extract the raw save files after getting them off your memory card.

  1) Open you save archive in PS2 Save Builder.
  2) Right-click on a file and select "Extract".
     1) NOTE: Most GTA:LCS save files contain a colon (`:`) in the name. This
        character is invalid in Windows file names and the file will fail to
        extract. Triple-click on the file in PS2 Save Builder to rename it and
        remove this character.
  3) Open the extracted file in the GTA:LCS Save Editor and make your edits.
  4) Add your edited file(s) back into the savedata by right-clicking in the
     file list and selecting "Add File".
  5) Save the file and copy the save onto your console using whatever tool
     you used to extract it initially (e.g. mymc).

### PSP
PSP saves are encrypted, so you'll have to decrypt them before the save editor
will be able to read them. You can use PPSSPP, the PSP emulator, to decrypt
saves.

  1) Download and install [PPSSPP](http://ppsspp.org/)
  2) Disable save encryption.
     1) Open the following file in a text editor:
          `<documents>/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/SYSTEM/ppsspp.ini`
     2) In the `[SystemParam]` section, add/edit the following line:
          `EncryptSave = False`
     3) Restart PPSSPP
  3) Locate the GTA:LCS save directory:
        `<documents>/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/SAVEDATA/<game_id>/`
     If you have not played GTA:LCS on PPSSPP before, create the save
     directory by playing through the first mission and saving the game.
  4) Pick a save slot and replace all the files in the folder with the files
     from the save you want to edit.
  6) Boot up GTA:LCS, load your game, and save it again. This will decrypt the
     save.
  7) Your decrypted save file will be loacted in:
        `<documents>/PPSSPP/memstick/PSP/SAVEDATA/<game_id>/DATA.BIN`
     Open this file in the GTA:LCS Save Editor and have fun! You do not need
     to re-encrypt the file unless you plan to play on a real PSP.
